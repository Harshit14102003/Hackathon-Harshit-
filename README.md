A website where you can explore popular locations of the world.
The website displays popular locations of the world like the sahara desert there are cards provided with each location on the side of the website page 
which shows us the important sublocations of the selected place
I have primarily focused on the designing portion of the website.
The website stands incomplete due to my focus on acads(upcoming compres)I have participated alone in this event i hope to complete the website as soon as my compres get over i will add a side navigation bar which opens on clicking the menu icon i will add flip card attribute to the flash cards which on turning show precise information about the sublocation.
